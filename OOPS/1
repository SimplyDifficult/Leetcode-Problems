Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where the complete software operates as a bunch of objects talking to each other.
An object is a collection of data and methods that operate on its data.

Why OOP?
1) The overall understanding of the software is increased as the distance between the language spoken by developers and that spoken by users.
2) Object orientation eases maintenance by the use of encapsulation.   One can easily change the underlying representation by keeping the methods same.

What are main features of OOP?
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance

What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is referred to one of the following two notions.
1) Data hiding: A language feature to restrict access to members of an object. For example, private and protected members in C++.
2) Bundling of data and methods together: Data and methods that operate on that data are bundled together.

Polymorphism means that some code or operations or objects behave differently in different contexts
Compile Time Polymorphism
Run Time Polymorphism:

The idea of inheritance is simple, a class is based on another class and uses data and implementation of the other class.
The purpose of inheritance is Code Reuse. 

What is Abstraction?
